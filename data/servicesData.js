        <p>
          My job is to solve problems that people see without creating new ones.
          One of my recent project is a parcel tracking system. I've used Django
          together with AWS Elastic Beanstalk for ease of CD and development. 
          You can find it <a url="http://packer-prod.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/?parcel_id=ProvidedByJeziorny"><u>here</u></a>.
